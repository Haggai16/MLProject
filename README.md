### End to End Machine Learning Project

This project investigates the impact of various socio-economic and educational factors on student performance in schools. I conducted a comprehensive analysis using machine learning techniques to identify key determinants of academic success. The project encompassed the following stages:

- Data Ingestion: Acquired and integrated student performance data from diverse sources, ensuring data quality and reliability.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth EDA to understand the relationships between variables, identify trends, and gain insights into how factors such as parental education level, lunch type, and test preparation courses correlate with student outcomes.

- Data Transformation: Engineered new features and preprocessed the data to optimize it for machine learning. This involved handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

- Pipeline Development: Developed robust and reproducible data processing pipelines using Python and scikit-learn.

- Machine Learning Modeling: Implemented and evaluated a range of machine learning algorithms, including including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting], to predict student performance. I focused on selecting the best-performing model based on relevant evaluation metrics e.g., RMSE, R-squared, MAE.

- Flask Application Development: Designed and developed a user-friendly web application using Flask to visualize key findings and potentially allow users to explore the relationships between different factors and student performance.

## Key Technologies:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Findings:
Parental education level was found to be a strong predictor of student success as well as the test preparation course.

## Impact and Applications:

- The insights from this project can be used to inform educational policies and interventions aimed at improving student outcomes.

- The Flask application provides a tool for educators and stakeholders to explore the data and understand the factors that influence student performance.

## Enhancements:
Future work may involve incorporating additional data sources, such as school resources and teacher qualifications, to further refine the model.
